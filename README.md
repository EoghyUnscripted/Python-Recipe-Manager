# The Hulbert Files
# Python-Recipe-Manager
# Author: Eoghan Hulbert
# Version: 1.0

This application is a Python rebuild of an original Java Core application that
was built as part of a college project. This application was a similar project
done for a college project while learning the Python language.

This version, like the predecessor, does not have a GUI but can be run in a
terminal environment with ease if Python is installed in your machine.

The purpose of this project was aimed at learning the basics of software dev
using Python programming language, such as building classes, objects, and
manipulating properties.

Due to the lack of database connection, this application will not store any
recipes once the application has been closed/exited.

v2.0

In the next iteration of this application, I plan to develop a front-end GUI
and database to store application data rather than local memory. Once these
items have been implemented, I will be able to add it to my online "Portal"
project to be hosted for testing as a web application.
